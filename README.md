# spatial-memory-task
This is an unity-based app for Memory research

The Gif image was a modified version in timing and stimulus duration for performance purpose.

Due to the limited size of Github for uploading, I will upload the full assets soon, while the current version included the scripts (under the folder './my_script/task_fmri') and stimuli material (human characters: files with *.fbm), those characters were downloaded from https://www.mixamo.com 

For details regarding the task, refer to the paper in this link:
